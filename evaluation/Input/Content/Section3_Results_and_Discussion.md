The PBPK model propofol was developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data after intravenous administration covering a dose range of 1-36mg/kg, including bolus infusion as well as continuous infusion clinical data. 

During the model-fitting, the following parameters were estimated (all other parameters were fixed to reported values):

*	K<sub>cat</sub> (as unique scaling factor f<sub>activityÂ </sub>, as described in [section 2.3.3](#233-metabolism-and-elimination)) 
*	Lipophilicity

The mean model fit resulted in an adequate description of all data, that showed to be highly variable. The reported 2.5 mg/kg bolus infusion data by Struys et al. ([Struys 2007](#5-references)) only contained concentration time profiles over 5 minutes. Nevertheless this data was included in the analysis, and showed overprediction in the first 2 minutes by the model, compared to available 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg data reported by Schnider et al. ([Schnider 1998](#5-references)) that was well described by the propofol PBPK model. This discrepancy in propofol distribution was assumed to be inter-study variability related.

Overall, the model results show that the PBPK model of propofol adequately described the data for all available doses.
